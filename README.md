Project Description:
IoT Security System Description
The IoT Security System is an intelligent and automated surveillance solution designed to enhance home or office security using Internet of Things (IoT) technology. It integrates a motion detection sensor with a camera module and leverages real-time communication to alert users instantly on their mobile devices.

Key Features:
Motion Detection:
Uses a PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor to detect any movement within its range. When motion is sensed, it triggers the system to take immediate action.

Image Capture:
Upon detecting motion, the system automatically captures a high-resolution image of the scene using a connected Raspberry Pi Camera module. This provides visual evidence of any intrusion or movement.

Real-Time Alerts:
The system sends instant notifications and the captured images to the userâ€™s mobile device via Telegram, ensuring the user is promptly informed about any suspicious activity, no matter where they are.

Automation and Ease of Use:
Designed to run continuously on a Raspberry Pi, the system operates autonomously with minimal human intervention. Alerts and images are transmitted automatically without requiring the user to monitor the system constantly.

Benefits:
Enhanced Security: Immediate detection and alerts help prevent theft, vandalism, or unauthorized access.

Remote Monitoring: Users can receive alerts and view images remotely on their smartphones through Telegram.

Cost-Effective: Utilizes affordable hardware like Raspberry Pi, PIR sensors, and free messaging platforms.

Scalable: Easily expandable by adding more sensors or integrating with other smart home devices.

Applications:
Home security to monitor entrances and sensitive areas

Office surveillance to protect assets and staff

Warehouse monitoring for unauthorized access

Any place requiring automated motion-triggered security alerts

This system effectively combines hardware sensors, image capture, and cloud communication to provide a reliable, real-time security monitoring solution that keeps users informed and their premises safe.
